  // populate a list of buttons with the movie titles of the top 3 results of the api call
  // User selects their movie and clicks appropriate button
  // Display a loading state because this part will take ages
  // make an axios/fetch call to moviedb based on the chosen movie's ID to get a random set of 3 keywords(MAYBE DO THIS BEFORE THEY SELECT THE MOVE?? AND DO IT FOR ALL 3 MOVIE OPTIONS -- STRETCH)
  // Using the keywords returned by the 2nd movieDB call, make a search query to giphy for each keyword
  // save the 3 gif urls to individual states
  // Render the gifs on the page using the urls and the movie overview saved in state
  // include a start-over button that clears the results component and returns the app to its original state.
