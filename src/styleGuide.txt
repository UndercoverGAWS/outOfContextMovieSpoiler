Creating Sass folders for our styles:

When including mixins to style elements, make sure they are above all othe styling for that element
When nesting all hover elements should be at the bottom of all the other stylings see Discord/assets for an example
When nesting within scss Try not to over never more than 4 nests deep

Make sure these are at the very top of the styles.scss file:
@import "setup";
@import "mixins";
@import "variables";

Nest styles wherever possible if it leads to cleaner/DRYer code
_Setup snippet
_Images
_Typography

_Mixins Ideas:
-Display Flex
-Fonts Styles
-Anchor styling
-Button styling
-Margin/Padding
-Border/Border Radius

_Variables
_Media Queries

Naming convention:
- camelCase
- maybe "kebob-case" for class names

Fonts:
html {
    font-size:62.5%
}

Using Rem's
- Kanit Light (light 300)
- Lato (regular 400)

Ordering of styles:
- Alphabetical order
- Split into blocks of similarly connected styles

Indentation:
Spaces: 2
indent 1 Space after Element for styling Example:h1 {}
indent 1 Space after colon for styling Example:
h1 {
color: red;
}
<------ Include and enter space between styling elements
h2 {
  color: blue;
}
